Quickly setup a minecraft spigot server with bungeecord.  

## Step 1.
Install the dependencies with python.  
```
[PYTHON EXECUTABLE] -m ensurepip
[PYTHON EXECUTABLE] -m pip install jproperties pyyaml
```

## Step 2
Open a shell / command prompt <ins>**IN THE DIRECTORY OF THE SCRIPT**</ins> 
```
[PYTHON EXECUTABLE] setup.py
```

## Step 3

Do as it says. When it launches the spigot server and it says done, type stop and press enter  
For bungeecord, when the prompt shows, type end and press enter  

## Step 4

You are done! (hopefully)
